<p>ICAP is a neat framework for thinking about how students learn. The gist of ICAP is that there are four ways of delivering information: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passive</strong>: Simply taking in information. For example, listening to a lecture. Watching a video. Quietly reading a book.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Manipulating concepts. For example, underlining text in a book, or working through a problem applying information just learned. </li>
<li><strong>Constructive</strong>: Figuring things out. Creating new information. For example, deriving a key theorem, writing a paper, or writing a critique of this course. </li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>: Learning through peer interactions. </li>
</ul>

<p>The terms used here mean very different things to different people. In particular, <strong>&quot;constructive learning&quot;</strong> has very different meanings in different research communities. For example, many members in educational philosophy use it interchangeably with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)"
target="[object Object]">constructivist learning</a>, which is at best weakly related to the ICAP definition (which comes from the cognitive science community). Likewise, &quot;active learning&quot; is often used to refer to anything which is not passive learning. Just to have a common language, throughout this unit we'll use the language of ICAP (and use &quot;constructivist&quot; when referring to the educational psychology definition).</p>

<p> The platform was originally designed to make it easier to move from passive learning to active learning and then to constructive learning (although not yet to interactive). Most courses on edX have gone as far as the first step -- active learning, using simple embedded "finger exercises". In this module, we'll explore these first three of the four modes and how to use technology to move towards constructive learning, in particular. </p>
