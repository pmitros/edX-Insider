<p>In this sequence, we will derive how to calculate the length of one edge of a right triangle from the lengths of the other two. This is called the Pythagorean Theorem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategy we will use will be to start with a right triangle. We will place four such triangles in such a way that they form a square. We will derive the area of the square in two different ways. Since it is the same square, we know the are has to be the same, so we will equate those. When we simplify, we will be left with a right triangle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Notice which triangles are similar, and label the lengths of the segments in the square.&nbsp;</p>
