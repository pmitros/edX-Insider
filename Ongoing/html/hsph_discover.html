<p>Through this exercise students discovered the apparent paradox that a better hospital might have a higher mortality rate than a worse hospital. Next, Marcello tied together what the students discovered, and began to walk them through a derivation of standardization and normalization.</p>
<p>One key point is that the students did the algebra. There are few things as disengaging as watching someone else do math. By being walked through the math, but doing the derivation themselves, students both learned more and were more engaged with the course.</p>
<p>In many cases, this didn't even involve explicit problems. Some of the course videos would end with "Solve for X," while the next one would start with "if you did this correctly, you should have gotten..."</p>
