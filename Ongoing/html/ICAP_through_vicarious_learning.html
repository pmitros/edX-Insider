<p>This section is completely optional. In the Kolb cycle you saw previously, there was a step that tied together application and theory. This sequence gives more of the theoretical basis behind constructive learning as used in the edX platform. This section is relatively rough, but it also experiments with several presentation styles.</p>
<p>There is a substantial body of literature that suggests that watching videos of expert-novice interactions is more effective than watching experts. This work was pioneered and originally popularized by Derek Muller (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcX3IW00nuk">TED Video
    overview</a>). It was rigorously studied and further developed by Miki Chi (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21635338">Miki's
        paper</a>), who found that watching videos of expert-novice interactions together in small groups, with the ability to pause, discuss, and rewind, was almost as effective as one-on-one tutoring. Results regarding student enjoyment have been mixed. In some cases, students find such videos confusing (but they learn more!), and in some cases, they like the additional personality of these videos.</p>
<p>Inspired by this, in the following video, Piotr Mitros walks David Cormier, the early pioneer who first coined the term MOOC (Massive Open Online Course, as well as a few students through how MITx/edX platform was designed around constructive learning, and what the term means in this context.</p>
